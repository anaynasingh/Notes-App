# Notes-App

This is a simple notes app that I built usng Flutter. It has a very user friendly interface and has multiple functionalities.
The user can sign in using their Google account and the notes are saved on cloud. The notes can have multiple colors and has sections like title, text area, date of creation and author name(optional).
The app demonstrates the simple CRUD operations.
